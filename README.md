# Low-Pass-filtering-using-VHDL-in-FPGA
This contains VHDL code for making a .bmp image less resoluted. This is achieved efficiently using FPGA board. We used several BRAM's to ensure all the pixels can be accessed at same time. Finally we filtered the image to a lower resolution using parallel programming.
The time complexity of this algo is unrivalled when compared to the sequential alogrithms.
